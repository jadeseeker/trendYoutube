		+George He Audio lmao. I read that second sentence in my super nerdy voice 
and it was awesome
		+VinceValentine Indeed it was. Though i kind of hate you now... cause now, 
I have to go read years worth of lore. ;) 
		+WyrusETS
You're very welcome! I was a sucker for the lore back in my active WoW 
days, glad my obsession was useful for once ;)
		+VinceValentine Mate, that was beautiful. Thank you. You get me hoked... I 
know the story from Warcraft 3 and on, so I'll read up on the first two! 
Well done on the summation, man! 
		+WyrusETS
Warcraft 1: Warchief Blackhand leads his army through the DP, the humans of 
Stormwind fight back. Canon ending: Orc assassin Garona kills King Llane 
Wrynn, the humans kill Medivh, Orgrim Doomhammer kills Blackhand and the 
Orcs destroy Stormwind (canon ending, the other being a human victory)
Warcraft 2: Lord Anduin Lothar, military leader of Stormwind, leads a group 
of survivors to Lordaeron. King Terenas Menethil (father of Arthas) joins 
the war, several human nations, the Dwarves of Ironforge and the High Elves 
of Silvermoon (precursors to the Blood Elves) join too and they form the 
Alliance. Orcs side with Trolls and Ogres and form the Horde. Warchief 
Doomhammer realizes Guldan has been dealing with Demons and kills him. 
Canon ending: The Alliance crushes the Horde and destroys the DP. Then 
there's a expansion pack where another DP opens, the Alliance sends an 
expedition including Khadgar, Alleria Windrunner etc. to Draenor where they 
finally destroy Horde resistance.
Warcraft 3: The surviving orcs live in prison camps in human lands. Thrall 
stages a revolution and leads the orcs to Kalimdor, where they discover the 
Night Elves. Illidan goes bonkers. The Alliance gets attacked by the 
Scourge, Prince Arthas Menethil is corrupted and kills his father King 
Terenas. Archimonde and the Burning Legion invade Moonglade. The spirit of 
Medivh rallies the leaders of the Alliance, the Horde and the Night Elves 
and together they destroy Archimonde. In the expansion, Illidan and his 
naga pals go to Draenor and Arthas becomes the Lich King.
And that's just the short version. If you care about the lore, look up 
Wowpedia or Wowwiki.
		+George He Audio I guess it is, the film is about the first invasion when 
the orcs take over Stormwind so I guess they would walk through Westfall :)
		+WyrusETS It's about the Second War. The Sundering happens during the War 
of the ancients which is fought some 10000 years prior to the First War and 
WC1
		+wheel dan So Wc1 was about the first dark portal and them coming over from 
Draenor, and that first, what was Wc 2 about? Does the sundering happen 
then? 
		+WyrusETS It's not Durotar. Durotar has a name in honor of Durotan, 
Thrall's father. Thrall himself given that land a name in a Third War. How 
do you think he named it if this is Durotar? He yelled from Draka's womb?
		+WyrusETS it will this is be for the frist darkportal
		+WyrusETS Don't worry, at least you know there were Warcraft games before 
WoW ;)
		I stand corrected, thanks boys. Origins and lore of first two Warcraft 
games are before my time. Hope the movie fills the gap.
		+warkinss yeah but its on screen as you can see. blizz may not have 
designed it till WoW but they could retrospectively put it in the lore. it 
makes sense, theyve been allied with dwarves and gnomes for ages and since 
westfall is a breadbasket, it makes sense for gnomes to invest some tech 
for the humans.
		+George He Audio they did not have harvest golems back then this during the 
first war
		+WyrusETS it's not durotar, they didn't go to Kalimdor till Warcraft 3.
		+George He Audio OMG you are right! Now the nerdgasm is even stronger.
		+George He Audio First i saw it, i thought Tarren Mill.
But you are def right, the golem gives it away!


It's also halfway between the Dank Portal and Stormwind, so there's at 
least some attention to detail already revealed!
		+K S arathi highlands are all mountain and clouds and reaaallly green. also 
just trolls there, horde never reached that far.
		+WyrusETS there are no Durotar at all during this time line, it hasn't been 
established yet. Thrall names the region after his dad after he establishes 
Orgrimmar. this is the first war, Thrall isn't even born yet. and there are 
no farm lands outside of Blastedlands as it was a military mountain range 
outpost.
		+K S Not enough snow/greens for Arathi Highlands. I'm telling ya, Durotar 
or just outside the portal 
		+George He Audio Looks more like Arathi Highlands, since maybe the Alterac 
Mtns are at the back?
		+George He Audio I think it is!! :O
		+WyrusETS Durotar was not explored until the orcs fled to Kalimdor in the 
early Third War. This movie is based on the First War.
		+WyrusETS Durotar in the first War? Durotar didn't exists in the first war.
		+WyrusETS that's not durotar. it's redridge mts or westfall
		+George He Audio Darkshire complete with sign post
		+George He Audio good eyes
		+George He Audio Doubtful, it's probably Durotar
		+George He Audio 0:07 is the assault on the Dark portal as well. :3
		+George He Audio holy shit it is! amazing spot haha

		Sci curious, you're claiming they're biased and that their claims are 
wrong, yet you aren't providing your proof that you are indeed right on 
whatever your bickering about. It's obvious you're just trying to rile up 
others with your comments or else you'd have ended this "debate" hours ago 
with simple cited sources. Of course they could do the same, but I'm 
targeting you in particular because you seem to be trolling...
		Why would America deserve the worst possible candidate? (Hillary and any 
republican besides rand) that's just silly talk 
		+Piecesrestonthabed +K Mat +edpoker69 
FFS, none of you can read properly. I'm not sure what part of me stating 
I'm undecided is incomprehensible to you. What I want is to have a 
discussion with people capable of distinguishing between facts and evidence 
vs their own biases, opinions, rumors, etc. But it seems NONE of Bernie's 
fans is capable of such a discussion. 
For crying out loud, you're as bad as Republicans with your lack of 
critical thinking skills, lack of fact-checking, and lack of basic reading 
comprehension. All you're interested in is a moronic pissing contest that 
fails to accomplish anything you hallucinate it to. 
I give up. So much for bouncing points off of people in the hope they're 
actually thoughtful, informed, and interested in reality instead of their 
own beliefs, biases, rumors, prejudices, etc.
I should have known better after the hysterical claims CNN deleted their 
poll that showed him winning, which was still there and hadn't been removed 
at all. Nobody bothered to fact-check that either before flying off the 
handle and spewing claims of a media conspiracy all across the web. 
If you're trying to drive people away from voting for him, keep it up. If I 
do chose to vote for him, there's no way I'll tell anyone lest they 
associate me with such knee-jerk reactionaries. 
		+SciCurious She was getting financial support from private prisons and 
indeed did receive $174,000 from them its been all over the news. Hillary 
is backed by many Super Pacs from corporate media and Wall st. and always 
has been. She publicly admits this but says its needed to compete 
and win. About your two points on honesty and strength. The first question 
directed towards her in the debate was that the American people associate 
her with the word liar and dishonesty. Hillary has told to many lies for me 
to comment on here. I don't feel like writing a book but here are two 
doozy's. She claims her daughter was jogging around the twin towers during 
the 911 attacks. Eventually had to confess her daughter was home at the 
time. She claimed that when she arrived at the airport in Benghazi she was 
under heavy gun fire. Video then surfaced showing her and her team walking 
the tarmac without incident. She then claimed later that she had misspoken. 
Strength is when you stand against many regardless and then history proves 
you right. Hillary votes or stands with whatever public opinion is at the 
time and usually ends up on the wrong side of history anyway. Then she 
always has to flip/flop years later because public opinions change and now 
oppose her. Throughout her whole political career Hillary has changed her 
views or flip/flopped dozen's of times for political gain.  I'm not putting 
her down and I'm not even voting but this is without doubt who Hillary is. 
Just another lying politician who will say and do anything for votes and to 
win. Actually I hope she doe's America deserves her or whatever psycho 
republican gets nominated.
		That bitch doesn't know whats better for her.
		Lets just appreciate that dhe doesnt support Trump
		+SciCurious You need help. You said you were leaning to vote for Hillary 
because you felt sorry for her and then you want to blame me when you, 
yourself forgot what you said. Give it a break already. If you want to 
support Hillary then that's fine but don't act like she's not corrupt. 
She's as corrupt as anyone one the republican side. She goes around wall 
street giving speeches for $250,000. Do you honestly believe anyone would 
pay her that much on a normal day to speak? I have never seen anyone try to 
defend her corruption. Her campaign run from it everytime it's brought up 
but you're here trying to do it. Good luck

These are her biggest backers.
Now read the list and give it a rest already.

		+SciCurious lol I don't get why you persist in trying to defend Hillary 
Clinton but you are "undecided"
		+K Mat *Please switch on your reading comprehension skills.* I said that I 
was undecided, not that I was going to vote for her. 
She's NOT taking the money from the private prisons. Talk about damned if 
you do and damned if you don't. That sort of thing is exactly what I was 
talking about when I said Bernie fans are irrational and reactionary. 
You said, " You are now trying to act like she's not bought? you sound 
ridiculous. Everyone knows that."
No, everyone *believes* that because people regurgitate things without 
fact-checking, especially when it fits their confirmation bias.
		+K Mat can it be mine?
		It's stupid to vote solely based on who's being attacked with slander. 
Especially by the voting public. There's good reason for Hillary to take 
heat though if you knew any thing about her history. Unfortunately for the 
GoP they aren't the most genuine of people either, Bernie has always been 
straight foward. His poitical ways unfortunately are always misinterpreted 
by the uneducated.
		Yes that's in reply to you. I am on a tablet so, I am using the youtube 
live feed. Which doesn't give the option to click reply.
		+K Mat Is this a response to me? It would help if you would use the reply 
links so it's clear who you're addressing. 
		Here read. This is your candidate
http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/10/23/3715544/clinton-private-prisons/
		You just won't give it up. You are now trying to act like she's not bought? 
you sound ridiculous. Everyone knows that. She had to give back money to 
the private prison industry for Pete sake. If you want to support her then 
that's your right. But she's a joke compared to Bernie Sanders. A damn joke.
		+K Mat Have you actually looked at who has donated to her campaign, the 
campaigns of the Republicans, and Bernie's? I have. That sort of thing has 
to be made public. The only people to receive multi-million dollar 
donations from individuals were Republicans, for example, and particularly 
Ted Cruz. Look up  those lists of contributors if you actually care who is 
bought.  
		+0FRIJOLERO You said, "Warner Bros payed her to support Hill blindly."
Where is your proof of that claim? 
		+Lucy Cakedog
  An even bigger sad of affairs will be seeing disappointed Bernie 
supporters after the primaries are over. See you in 4 months.
		Warner Bros payed her to support Hill blindly.
		That's your right, this is a democracy. I already said what I had to say. 
At the very least don't pretend like she's come kind of Victim. This is the 
same women who pushed for wars that took the lives of many Americans and 
people around the world. Spare me that nonsense. After the votes are 
counted, we will see if a corporate warmonger like her wins. Or if an 
honest man like Bernie wins. And that's that.
		+SciCurious I like how that's the best thing Hillary supporters can think 
of to justify her record. They also think attacking Bernie on something 
like his 2007 vote means anything when in reality he pulled an Abraham 
Lincoln in that case. People educated on the civil war will know exactly 
what I'm referring to. When that fails they try calling Bernie sexist or a 
gun nut. When that fails they turn into radicals/neo-conservatives and call 
him socialist or commie without knowing what they mean. A sad state of 
affairs.
		+K Mat I haven't decided who to vote for. The irrational attacks on Clinton 
both from Republicans and Bernie fans has caused me to take a closer look 
at her, and I'm now leaning her way. She's put up with having a whole lot 
of slander and outright lies spewed about her, and she hasn't backed down. 
That kind of courage is what I want in a president. 
		Changing your mind is one thing. But changing to get votes is another. If 
you believe that Hillary changed her mind you are mistaken. It's all lip 
service of her telling people what they want to hear. I am in the middle of 
making a video where it slipped out of her mouth that, that was going to be 
her strategy. I will put it up when it's done. Your candidate is a wall 
street whore and we don't want her.
		+K Mat Some of you Bernie fans are every bit as irrational and reactionary 
as Trump's. Who wants a politician to never change their views in light of 
new or better information? It's not a virtue to be wrong and stubbornly 
stay that way. And staying stubbornly wrong isn't something smart people 
do; smart people change their views to match facts and reality. 
		+K Mat
however you want to justify it he was against gay marriage back then. So 
his views can evolve but Hillary's can't? how convenient.
		Bernie wasn't against anything. Burlington became the first state in the 
entire country to grant civil union and the city almost broke out into 
civil war, over it. The city was divided, he said the state might need a 
little more time. Since they were the first to push for civil unions. The 
man's record is impeccable when it comes to LGBT. It makes Hillary look 
like a joke
		+K Mat funny you mention that because Bernie was against same sex marriage 
in 2007
		it's her choice and vote. if you don't like it then I'm sorry but she won't 
change it just for some viewers
		+jtbowman132 Dude, I'm not sure if this was anti-Bernie. I enjoyed it, and 
I'm a Bernie supporter (and donator.)
		+jtbowman132 Who she supports and why is entirely up to her. Everyone gets 
one vote, and like you Ellen gets to use hers as she sees fit.
		+jtbowman132 It's sickening. She had Hillary on talking about her sad 
history of support for LGBT and portraying her as a fighter for minorities 
and when Bernie came on she had the man playing a cue card game. She was 
trying her best to get him not to speak about issues. It's sickening. Ellen 
can go suck a dick.

		99grow...  you have a point.  I hadn't seen that.  it does make me feel 
somewhat better about the whole thing.  the net of the two videos seems 
more favorable to Hillary, though not as heavy-handedly than if there had 
only been the Bernie video, and I think a certain amount of rooting for her 
preferred candidate is reasonable.
		+Steven H if this is demeaning to Bernie, doesn't that mean that Ellen 
"demeaned" Hillary with her "Hillary makes an elegant entrance" video?
		shut the fuck up the US government is an oligarchy you voting for one 
aristocrat isn't going to change the fact that an aristocrat will hold 
office. We have Hillary running who is wife of a past president, a brother 
of a past president (Jeb), a billionaire running, and then some extras 
thrown in who won't win. We need to find a new system of government and 
remove the presidential position, add a prime minister and several other 
heads of government that hold total power in their specific areas.
		+Steven H Hey, name recognition and this can get him through people so 
people get to know him
		bingo.  the day after Bernie's first ad drops, we get this attempt to 
demean him with these images.
		+Steven H They'd pull the gender/victim card again.
		+GrilledZucchinis imagine if Bill Maher had made a video like this about 
Hillary... what would the reaction to that have been?
